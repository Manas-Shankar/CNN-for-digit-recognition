# CNN-for-digit-recognition
A Convolutional Neural Network created using Keras and sklearn . Uses the 'MNIST digits' dataset . Can classify images of digits between 0 and 9. Currently accepts as input 28*28 px images with a single channel (grayscale). Plots include loss vs epochs, accuracy vs epochs, and the confusion matrix. Final section makes predictions on the unseen test dataset, index changeable to check accuracy of predictions.
